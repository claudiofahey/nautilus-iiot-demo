# Nautilus Industrial IoT Demo

## Overview

This projects demonstrates how to use several key features of Nautilus to perform real-time analytics
and visualization on streaming Internet-Of-Things (IOT) data.

## Components

- Pravega: Pravega provides a new storage abstraction - a stream - for continuous and unbounded data. 
  A Pravega stream is a durable, elastic, append-only, unbounded sequence of bytes that has good performance and strong consistency.

  Pravega provides dynamic scaling that can increase and decrease parallelism to automatically respond
  to changes in the event rate.

  See <http://pravega.io> for more information.

- Flink: Apache FlinkÂ® is an open-source stream processing framework for distributed, high-performing, always-available, and accurate data streaming applications.
  See <https://flink.apache.org> for more information.
  
- Streaming Data Generator: A streaming data generator has been
  created that can playback data and send it to the REST gateway.
  This is a Python script and is in the [streaming_data_generator](streaming_data_generator) directory.
  
- Gateway: This is a REST web service that receives JSON documents from the Streaming Data Generator.
  It parses the JSON and then writes it to a Pravega stream.
  This is a Java application and is in the [gateway](gateway) directory.

- Flink Streaming Job: This is a Java application that defines a job that can be executed in the Flink cluster.
  This particular job simply reads the events from Pravega and loads them into Elasticsearch for visualization.
  This is in the [flinkprocessor](flinkprocessor) directory. 
  
- Elasticsearch: This stores the output of the Flink Streaming Job for visualization.

- Kibana: This provides visualization of the data in Elasticsearch.

- Docker: This demo uses Docker and Docker Compose to greatly simplify the deployment of the various
  components on Linux and/or Windows servers, desktops, or even laptops.

## Running the Demo

### Install Docker and Docker Compose

See <https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/>
and <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>.

### Install Elasticsearch and Kibana

- `cd docker-elk ; docker-compose up -d`

- Open Kibana. 
  <http://localhost:5601/>

- Import Kibana objects from `taxidemo-kibana-export.json`.

### Build Pravega and Connectors

```
cd pravega
./gradlew install 
./gradlew startStandalone

cd flink-connectors
./gradlew install

cd hadoop-connectors
./gradlew install
```

### Run Applications

```
mvn install:install-file \
-Dfile=pravega-credentials-0.6-13013.3f8d24f.jar \
-DpomFile=pravega-credentials-0.6-13013.3f8d24f.pom
```

- Build the Gateway.
  ```./gradlew gateway:distTar```

- Build Docker containers.
  ```docker-compose build```

- Start Pravega, Gateway, and Streaming Data Generator.
  ```docker-compose up -d```

### Run Flink Jobs

- The Flink jobs can be executed with Nautilus, another Flink cluster, or in standalone mode.  
  In standalone mode, a mini Flink cluster will execute within the application process.
  When run in the IntelliJ IDE, standalone mode will be used by default.
  
- Flink jobs are in the flinkprocessor directory.

- To view the raw data streaming on the console, run the job by using the following parameters:
```
--jobClass io.pravega.example.iiotdemo.flinkprocessor.StreamToConsoleJob
--controller tcp://$PRAVEGA_HOST_ADDRESS:9090 
--input-stream iot/data 
```

- Run the Raw Data job by using the following parameters:
```
--jobClass io.pravega.example.iiotdemo.flinkprocessor.StreamRawDataToElasticsearchJob
--controller tcp://$PRAVEGA_HOST_ADDRESS:9090 
--input-stream iot/data 
--elastic-sink true 
--elastic-host $ELASTIC_HOST 
--elastic-delete-index true
```

- Run the Extract Statistics job with the following parameters:
```
--jobClass io.pravega.example.iiotdemo.flinkprocessor.StreamStatisticsToElasticsearchJob
--controller tcp://$PRAVEGA_HOST_ADDRESS:9090 
--input-stream iot/data 
--elastic-sink true 
--elastic-host $ELASTIC_HOST 
--elastic-delete-index true
```

## Building the Demo

### Install Operating System

Install Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Other operating systems can also be used but the commands below have only been tested
on this version.

### Install Java

```
apt-get install default-jdk
```

### Install IntelliJ

Install from <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea>.
Enable the Lombok plugin. 
Enable Annotations (settings -> build, execution, deployment, -> compiler -> annotation processors).
